### Environment requirements

> [!WARNING]
> Astro 6.0+ requires Node.js 22.12.0 or newer. Odd-numbered Node.js versions such as 23 are not supported by Astro.

You can choose one of the following methods for project development:

- [Bun](https://bun.com/get)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

For deployment methods using container like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install), please refer the documention [Using Docker Compose](https://astro-pure.js.org/docs/setup/using-docker-compose).

### Getting started

1. Clone the repository and enter the directory:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/cworld1/astro-theme-pure.git
   cd astro-theme-pure
   ```

   Edit `src/site.config.ts` to customize the site.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   bun install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   bun dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   yarn run dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

   The development server runs at <http://localhost:4321> by default.

### Creating a new blog article

After setting up either development environment, you can create a new blog article:

```shell
bun pure new
```

## Deployment

### Manual deployment

Build the production site into the `./dist` directory:

```shell
bun run build
```

Once the build is complete, the generated static files will be located in the `./dist` directory. You can deploy this directory to any platform that supports static site hosting.

Preview the production build locally:

```shell
bun preview
```

### Static hosting platforms

You can deploy your blog to any static site hosting platform.

- Refer to the official [Astro Deployment Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) for specific deployment methods.
- Depending on the deployment platform you choose, you may need to modify the `astro.config.ts` configuration file in the project.
